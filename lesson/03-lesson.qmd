## Part 1: Data visualization with {ggplot2}

For the first part of this week's lesson, you need to work through Posit's introductory primers for {ggplot2}. You'll do these in your browser and type code and see results there.

It seems like there are a lot, but they're short and go fairly quickly (especially as you get the hang of the `ggplot()` syntax). Complete these:

- **Visualize Data**
  - [Exploratory data analysis](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/01-eda/)
  - [Bar Charts](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/02-bar-charts/)
  - [Histograms](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/03-histograms/)
  - [Boxplots and counts](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/04-boxplots/)
  - [Scatterplots](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/05-scatterplots/)
  - [Line plots](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/06-line-graphs/)
  - [Overplotting and big Data](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/07-overplotting/)
  - [Customize your plots](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/visualize-data/08-customize/)


## Part 2: Reshaping data with {tidyr}

For the last part of this week's lesson, you'll work through just one primer to learn how to use the {tidyr} package to reshape data from wide to long and back to wide.

Complete this:

- **Tidy Your Data**
  - [Reshape Data](https://r-primers.andrewheiss.com/tidy-data/01-reshape-data/)
