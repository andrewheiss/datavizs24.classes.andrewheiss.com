# Task 1: Reflection

Put your reflection here


# Task 2: Interactive plots

```{r}
#| label: load-libraries-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Load data here
```

Do the following:

1. Make a plot. Any kind of plot will do (though it might be easiest to work with `geom_point()`).

2. Make the plot interactive with `ggplotly()`. 

3. Make sure the hovering tooltip is more informative than the default.

Good luck and have fun!


# Task 3:

Install the {flexdashboard} package and create a new Quarto file in your project by going to File > New File… > Quarto Document… > From Template > Flexdashboard.

Using [the documentation for {flexdashboard} online](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/using.html), create a basic dashboard that shows a plot (static or interactive) in at least three chart areas. Play with the layout if you're feeling brave.
