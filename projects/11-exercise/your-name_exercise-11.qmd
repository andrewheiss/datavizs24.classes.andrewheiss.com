# Task 1: Reflection

Put your reflection here


# Task 2: Interactive plots

```{r}
#| label: load-libraries-data
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Load data here
```

Do the following:

1. Make a plot. Any kind of plot will do (though it might be easiest to work with `geom_point()`).

2. Make the plot interactive with `ggplotly()`. 

3. Make sure the hovering tooltip is more informative than the default.

Good luck and have fun!


# Task 3:

Create a Quarto dashboard in a new .qmd file that shows a plot (static or interactive) in at least three chart areas. [See the example for this session](https://datavizs24.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/11-example.html#making-a-dashboard-with-quarto) for resources on creating dashboards in Quarto.
