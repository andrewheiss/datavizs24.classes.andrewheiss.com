# Task 1: Reflection

Put your reflection here


# Task 2: Enhanced plot

When you knit this document, you will create and save a basic bar chart of hot dog eating contest winners. You will then open the resulting file in a [vector editing program](https://datavizs24.classes.andrewheiss.com/resource/graphics-editors.html).

Be sure that you save your file **with a different name**. You don't want to accidentally overwrite all your enhancements and updates when you knit this document. That would be so sad.

library(tidyverse)
library(svglite)

hotdogs <- read_csv("data/hot-dog-contest-winners.csv") |>
  rename(dogs = `Dogs eaten`, record = `New record`) |>
  mutate(record = factor(record))

# Change the colors here if you want
# (or anything else if you want too)
plot_hotdogs <- ggplot(hotdogs, 
                       aes(x = Year, y = dogs, fill = record)) +
